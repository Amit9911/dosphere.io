        <h1>Privacy Policy for TaskTrove</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 26, 2025</p>
        <p>Thank you for choosing TaskTrove ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage it.</p>

        <!-- NEW SECTION ADDED HERE -->
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            TaskTrove uses Google Play Services, including the In-App Updates API, to ensure you have the latest and most stable version of the app. To facilitate this, and to help us diagnose problems, we may collect the following types of data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics Data:</strong> This includes crash logs and performance data (e.g., ANR reports). This information is collected anonymously and helps us identify, diagnose, and fix bugs and improve the performance of our application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
            All the personal content you create, including your tasks, categories, due dates, and any other content, is stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or have access to this personal content.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How Your Data is Used</h2>
        <p>
            The diagnostic data we collect is used solely for the purpose of maintaining and improving app functionality and stability. All personal task information remains on your device and is only used by the application to provide its core features to you.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share any user data with third-party companies or services. The diagnostic data collected is processed by Google Play Services and is only accessible to us for app maintenance purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            If you uninstall the TaskTrove application, all personal application data stored on that device will be permanently deleted. The anonymous diagnostic data we collect is not linked to your personal account and cannot be deleted upon request.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>
