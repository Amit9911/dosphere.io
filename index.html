        <h1>Privacy Policy for DoSphere</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 23, 2025</p>

        <p>
            Thank you for choosing DoSphere ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your privacy is critically important to us. Our fundamental principle is to not collect any of your personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
            DoSphere is designed to be a completely private and offline application. All the data you create, including your tasks, categories, due dates, and any other content, is stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal data. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, or any other personal identifiers.</li>
            <li>The content of your tasks or categories.</li>
            <li>Location data.</li>
            <li>Contacts or calendar information.</li>
            <li>Device-specific information or usage analytics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How Your Data is Used</h2>
        <p>
            Since all data is stored locally on your device, it is only used by the application to provide you with its core functionality. We do not use your data for any other purpose, such as advertising or analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            DoSphere does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect information from you.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            If you uninstall the DoSphere application from your device, all application data stored on that device, including all of your tasks, will be permanently deleted as part of the standard uninstallation process managed by the Android operating system.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>
